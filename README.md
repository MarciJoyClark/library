# library
library project

I don't know how to move a SQL DB to github since the MySQL server connection isn't accessible from the harddrive as far as I can tell.
I used ApexSQL to generate script that (supposedly) should give you access to all of the DB folders and files.
I hope it works! I used Red-Gate to transfer things the last time, but I don't have the several hundred dollars required to continue
using it . . .

Library3.SQL is the file where the code I wrote is contained. The other two are whatever Apex did.
